# plantSound
a place to hold code to do arduino and processing sound interaction


discussion of sending serial from arduino to processing
in the end used println to send it in arduino and string and convert to float in processing
I had run into this serial problems before and had forgotten how to solve them

synth

addapted the code from

https://processing.org/tutorials/sound/#example-1-2-synthesizer

can use two differnt capacitive touch sensors at the moment I am just using one for the synth

# the 2 programs that make the sound work are

arduino capcitiveTouch2sensors  and 

processing serialReadStringTwoValues
